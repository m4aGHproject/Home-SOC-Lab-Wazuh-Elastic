#Security Analyst & SOC Engineer  
**Threat Detection | Incident Response | SIEM | Cloud Security**

I build practical cybersecurity labs, write detection rules, and break down complex security problems into simple playbooks anyone can follow. My focus is hands-on security: SIEM engineering, threat analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and cloud security hardening.
